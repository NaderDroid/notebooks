<title>Network services scenarios</title>
</head><body>Here we discuss some issues in networking<br/>
<br/>
one main issue that most sysadmins face is the dhcp server managment and how to control the list of ips and reservations made by hosts on the server<br/>
<br/>
=== review <br/>
<br/>
- dhcp needs to consider devices that run all time on the network and reservations of hosts<br/>
<br/>
- mac reservation can be used to define devices that need to be connected all times to the network<br/>
<br/>
- IPAM is a new tool that used to keep managing alloted ip ranges in servers and VM farms<br/>
