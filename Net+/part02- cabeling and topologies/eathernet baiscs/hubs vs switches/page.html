<title>hubs vs switches</title>
</head><body>a hub is nothing but multiport repeater<br/>
the hub job is to recieve a frame and repeats it to all connected devices on the hub<br/>
<br/>
the problem with the 10BaseT hub: it uses the CSMA/CD<br/>
- the bandwidth is devided among all connected devices which degregate bandwidth significantly<br/>
- only one device can talk at a time.<br/>
- switches use mac address to forward messages<br/>
