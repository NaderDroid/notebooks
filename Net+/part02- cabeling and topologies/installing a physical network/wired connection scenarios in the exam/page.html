<title>wired connection scenarios in the exam</title>
</head><body>all the scenarios in the exam can be categorized into two main groups:<br/>
<br/>
1- poor or slow connection: the main issues that will cause this are:<br/>
<br/>
a- attenuation: where the signal weakens over distance and that's why we have very strict rules when it comes to distances in TIA.<br/>
b- jitter: is when packets get dropped and resent very frequently due to low bandwidth or other factors. the solution is buffering<br/>
c- incorrect cabling: cable mismatch causes connection to be slow or breaks frequently. solution is to ensure cable compatability<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2- No connection at all:<br/>
<br/>
a- bad ports: this happens when switch port goes dead and creating a loopback with the workstation itself<br/>
b- TX/RX reverse: mixing up cabling of crossover and straight through<br/>
c- bent pins: this could be an issue<br/>
d- open/short: this is when the problem is with the cabling especially with crimping of the rj-45<br/>
