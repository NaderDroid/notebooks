<title>FTP</title>
</head><body>- uses ports 20 and 21 for communication<br/>
- the anonymous famous ftp account allows puplic to access the ftp server and files on it<br/>
- ftp client sends request on port 21 and the ftp server responds back on port 20 and this is a great example of the concept port triggering where we allow some ports to open up if other ports are receving packets<br/>
- the get command downloads and the put command uploads to the ftp server<br/>
- ftp is not encrypted protocol - means all data are in asci format<br/>
- there is another protocol called TFTP - trivial ftp - and its identical to ftp excepts that it uses port 69 and the UDP instead of tcp, hence its more lightweight<br/>
