<br/>
=== review <br/>
<br/>
- Netbios is an old protocol that manages the connections based on the computer name within a lan network<br/>
<br/>
- Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a protocol that allows hosts to name resolution hosts on the same network<br/>
<br/>
- nbtstat is a diagnostic command that can be useful but it has some issues of incompatability with the new (LLMNR) protocol<br/>
