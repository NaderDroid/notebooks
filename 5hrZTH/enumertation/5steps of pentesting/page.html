<title>5steps of pentesting</title>
</head><body>Here is the five steps to perform in literally any pentesting<br/>
<br/>
1- Reconniscance == information gathering<br/>
a- passive: this is done without direct interaction with the org that we are testing. We use public info to gather as much info as we can<br/>
b- active: done with direct interaction with the org and its systems to find vulns<br/>
<br/>
2- scanning: using tools like nikto and namp looking for vulns and services to enumerate and perform our attacks<br/>
<br/>
3- gain access: when exploit the system here we try to gain access to admin or user accoount <br/>
<br/>
4- maintain access: how to keep our access until we're done performing our exploitation of the system or network. Also how to find back doors to the system in case the user is disconnected from the network<br/>
<br/>
5- &nbsp;covering tracks: how to delete our tracks like logs and other footprint that could get us to gail<br/>
