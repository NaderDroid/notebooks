<title>Assign ip address from the DHCP server</title>
</head><body>To get access to the internet you need a DHCP assigned ip address and this is done automatically using the dhcp server in linux<br/>
<br/>
to get a new ip you simply need to repoot the system so the process dhcpd would start over and assign new address to the NIC<br/>
<br/>
however, this can be done without restarting the machine:<br/>
<br/>
just you need to call the dhcp process and a new ip will be assigned, the command to call the dhcpd is:<br/>
<br/>
dhclient eth0<br/>
<br/>
