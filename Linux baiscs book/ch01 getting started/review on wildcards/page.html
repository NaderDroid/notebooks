<title>review on wildcards</title>
</head><body>a Quick Look at wiLdcardS<br/>
Let’s say we’re doing a search on a directory that has the files cat, hat, what,<br/>
and bat. The ? wildcard is used to represent a single character, so a search<br/>
for ?at would find hat, cat, and bat but not what, because at in this filename is<br/>
preceded by two letters. The [] wildcard is used to match the characters that<br/>
appear inside the square brackets. For example, a search for [c,b]at would<br/>
match cat and bat but not hat or what. Among the most widely used wildcards<br/>
is the asterisk (*), which matches any character(s) of any length, from none to<br/>
an unlimited number of characters. A search for *at, for example, would find<br/>
cat, hat, what, and bat</body></html>
