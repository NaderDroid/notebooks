<title>manage processes</title>
</head><body>To manage process we use the command `nice`. <br/>
<br/>
- nice takes a number which reflect how nice you are to others. for example, if you use high number means the priority goes down and you are nice to other processes. If using a low number that means you are not nice in sharing the resources with other processes. however the priority goes up.<br/>
<br/>
- the range of nice numbers from -20 to +19<br/>
<br/>
ex: nice -n -10 &lt;process name&gt;<br/>
<br/>
==== change the priority of a running process =====<br/>
<br/>
to change the priority use the command `renice`<br/>
<br/>
ex: renice 16 &lt;process ID&gt;<br/>
