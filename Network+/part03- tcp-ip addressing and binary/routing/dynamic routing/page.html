<title>Dynamic routing</title>
</head><body>There is one term here to be aware of (Convergence)<br/>
<br/>
Convergence means the ability for router to rewrite routing tables to adapt to network faliure and changes and reroute traffic accordingly. Simply means all router tables reflect all routers<br/>
<br/>
- Dynamic routing is the router smartness to route traffic and assign routers routing tables that fit the current network status<br/>
<br/>
- In old days there were two ways to determine the route of the traffic <br/>
a- distance vector: this uses the hop count to determine the shortest path<br/>
b- link state: this uses what's know as (advertising) which is baisically binging the machines connected to and if any noticed changes in response it will update its routing table and recommend other routers to do so.<br/>
<br/>
=== review points <br/>
<br/>
- Dynamic routing protocols use metrics to determine routes and either distance vector or link state<br/>
<br/>
- Dynamic routing protocols are either EGP, Exterior Gateway Protocol or IGP, Interior Gateway Protocol<br/>
<br/>
- BGP is the EGP used protocol used for inter autnomous system routing<br/>
