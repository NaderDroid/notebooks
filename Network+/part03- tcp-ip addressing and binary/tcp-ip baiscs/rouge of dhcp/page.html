<title>rouge of dhcp</title>
</head><body>in this episode we disscus the main issues in dhcp connection and how to dignose it to solve dhcp connection issues<br/>
<br/>
- if no connection but you see weird wack 16 ip address then its a APIPA which is Automatic Private IP Address and its the fall back ip address if the dhcp client failed to acquire ip address from the dhcp server. it usually <b>starts with 169.254</b><br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
- if u get APIPA address, make sure you are connected to a dhcp server<br/>
- if you are connected to dhcp server and still get error, make sure that your dchp server is configured properly<br/>
- if you get ip address other than your network id, you may have `Rouge DHCP Server`. which is baiscally you are getting a response to the dhcp client from other than the intended dhcp server.<br/>
