<title>connecting ethernet scenarios</title>
</head><body>there are many things to consider when connecting switches together<br/>
1- loop issues or bridging loops: when connecting switches watch out for loops. This can be solved with STP, spanning tree protocol<br/>
2- flood issues: this can solved using new switches by just turning off the port that is flooding the switch or the network<br/>
3- missmatch switch: this is rare scenario that switch is not wroking becuase the speed issues<br/>
4- dedicated high speed ports: utilize ports that support high speed by connecting them together<br/>
5- uplink and crossover: uplink goes to regular with striaght cable or crossover cable from regular to regular ports<br/>
6- duplex mismatch: devices need to support full duplex to connect this done automatically but some times needs to be configured manually<br/>
