<title>gigabit ethernet and 10-gigabit ethernet</title>
</head><body>there are four gigabit ethernet that are going to be on the exam<br/>
<br/>
1- 1000BaseCX: it uses coaxial cable called Twinax and has a range of 25m between the node and the switch<br/>
2- in the fiber optic we have 2 different standards <br/>
a- 1000BaseSX multimode for 500m distance<br/>
b- 1000BaseLX single mode for distance 5km<br/>
3- for UTP, unshielded twisted pair 1000BaseT with distance 100m<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand there is the 10gigabit networks and those have different standards<br/>
1- 10GBaseT: if uses cat6 it runs for 55m and if uses cat6a it runs the normal 100m<br/>
2- in fiber optic we have the <br/>
a- 10GBaseSR multimode<br/>
b- 10GBaseLR single mode 1310nm, and runs upto 10km<br/>
c- 10GBaseER single mode 1550nm, runs up to 40km<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====&#09;review&#09;====<br/>
<br/>
- know the 1000Base types distance names and node numbers<br/>
- know the 10GBase types distance names and node numbers<br/>
<br/>
